    Now comes the first thing we have never seen before, namely TypeScript.
    Try to read it and guess what it does, write in a comment what you think it will do
    Next use Google, ChatGPT and/or Claude to find out what it does.
    write in another comment what it actually does and see if it is far from what you thought it did
    - ->
    <script>
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    </script>
</body>
</html>

<!--My incling tells me that h1 heading will turn from greeting to "Hello, world!"-->
<!--Typescripts purpose is to acquire the html content inside an element, by setting "Hello, world" between the opening and closing h1 tags, the content will then be altered accordingly-->
