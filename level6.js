//you can comment this file too by adding // before the comment
let greeting = "Hello, world!";
document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = greeting;

//from now on all the HTML files will look the same so there is no need to comment them
// let is a variable used to declare this also means that the value can be chaned later in the script when needed. This mean greeting is to be altered to "Hello, world!"//
//innerHTML sets the inner content of the html of the selected element of h1 to the value stored in the greeting variable which is "Hello, world!"//
